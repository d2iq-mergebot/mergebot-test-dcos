# DC/OS - The Datacenter Operating System

The easiest way to run microservices, big data, and containers in production.


# What is DC/OS?

Like traditional operating systems, DC/OS is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

Unlike traditional operating systems, DC/OS spans multiple machines within a network, aggregating their resources to maximize utilization by distributed applications.
