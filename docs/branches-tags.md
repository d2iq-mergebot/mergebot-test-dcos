# DCOS Branches and Tags

* Have only major number branches like 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and master.

* Use git tag to tag releases like 1.10.0.beta1, 1.10.0.beta2 of master or 1.9.3. 
  * Use strictly incremental versions.

* When 1.10 is GA, branch master to 1.10.0 to SHA that was released as GA.

* The master at that point is future 1.11.0 , and step 2 could continue for next iteration when 1.11.0 is released as GA.
What do you think?

* Add Change 1
* Add Change 2
