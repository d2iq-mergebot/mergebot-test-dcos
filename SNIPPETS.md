Here's one code snippet for both sequences:
<div class="snippet" sequences="first,second">
  
```
ls -a
```
  
</div>

Here's a code snippet for only the first sequence:
<div class="snippet" sequences="first">
  
```
echo "I'm in the first sequence"
```
  
</div>

Here's a code snippet for only the second sequence:
<div class="snippet" sequences="second">
  
```
echo "I'm in the second sequence"
```
  
</div>
